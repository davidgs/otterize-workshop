## Installing the camera module

> **Note:** The camera module is very delicate. Be careful when handling it.
> The parts of the clamp are also very delicate so be extra careful when opening and closing it.

First, you'll need to open the little black clamp on the top of the ESP32-CAM

  Insert the camera ribbon cable into the clamp and close the black tab completely.

  **Note:** This is a delicate piece of plastic, so be very careful with it. Do not force it. If you do, you'll damage the camera module.

  The camera is now assembled and ready to use! Let's move on to putting the rest of the hardware together.
