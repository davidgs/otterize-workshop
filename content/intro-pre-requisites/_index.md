### Introduction

In this workshop we'll be building a simple WiFi camera that you can use to take pictures and have them emailed to you. We'll be using the [ESP32-CAM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RPQJG6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) dev-kit to build our camera. The ESP32-CAM is a low-cost WiFi camera module with a built-in microSD card slot that can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. The ESP32-CAM is a great dev-kit for building IoT devices that require a camera.


### Workshop pre-requisites

You'll need the following:
- Dev-kit (supplied)
- A copy of [Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) installed locally
