## A working camera!

You should now have a working camera! To take pictures:
- Press the shutter button
- Check your email

No pictures are saved on the device, so if you want to keep a picture, you'll need to save it from your email.

## What's next?

There are a lot of things you can do with this project. Here are a few ideas:
- Add a battery and make it portable
- Add an SD Card and have it save pictures locally
- Change the 'Reset' button to:
  - Turn the flash on/off
  - Change to 'video' mode and send a short video clip

## What did you learn?

This workshop was designed to teach you about:
- The ESP32-CAM
- Arduino programming
- The Arduino IDE
- Hooking up hardware

I hope you enjoyed it!
