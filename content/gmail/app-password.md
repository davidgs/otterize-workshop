## Setting up an Application Specific Password

For this workshop we won't be using your *actual* GMail password (because that would be insane). Instead, we will be using an application-specific password.

To create an app-specific password, go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) and click on `Security` in the left-hand menu, then click on `2 Factor Authentication`. At the bottom of that page, you'll see a box for 'App Passwords'. Click on that and you'll be able to create a new app password.

On this page, we will create a password for an `Other` app.

Once you give it a name, you will see the generated App Password. Copy that and save it somewhere safe. You will need it later.

(Don't worry that I showed you mine, I already deleted it!)

## Save it somewhere safe!

THis is the **only** time you will see that password. Once you close the window, you can never see it again. If you lose it, you will need to create a new one.

## That's it for GMail setup!

Now let's move on to the fun stuff!!
