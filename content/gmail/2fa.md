## What is 2FA?

Security (in the sense of passwords) is best when there are 2 (or more) parts to it.

- Something you *know* (like a password)
- Something you *have* (like a phone, or a hardware token)

It's relatively easy for someone to get your password, but it's much harder for them to get your password *and* your phone.

**Note:** You should absolutely set up 2FA on any and all accounts that allow it! It's a great way to protect yourself from hackers.

## Setting up 2FA on google

Login to your google account and go to your Account Settings page:

![Account Settings](/otterize-workshop/gmail/images/google-account.png)

Then click on `Security` in the left-hand menu:

Then click on `2-Step Verification` and set up 2fa. You may need to download a 2 factor authentication app for your phone if you don't already have one.

As you can see above, I have 3 hardware authentication keys (I always have one with me, and one in safe storage at home!) and I also have the google authenticator app on my phone. I can use any of those to log in to my google account.

> **Note:** If you haven't already, you should absolutely set up 2FA on your GitHub account as well!
