# This is meant to be fun and educational!

So let's make sure we have some fun.

## What's the point?

We will be building both hardware and software, so at the end of this you can truly say you are a "Full-Stack" developer.

Plus, at the end, you'll have a WiFi-enabled camera that takes pretty decent pictures!

## Following along

This entire tutorial has some very detailed instructions, so you should be able to follow along.

If you don't understand something, please just shout out!

There are no dumb questions! This is likely your very first adventure into building hardware and embedded software, so give yourself the grace of not knowing, and ask questions!
